# tradebot
eventually an experimental trading bot

also a lab to simulate trading strategies

# what?

this is old code written by An, to play with the stock market using  Alpaca Markets API.

All of this code should be considered legacy. It should not be expected to run.

Yet I wouldn't be surprised if it almost did.

# how?

An did this on his spare time. Quick and dirty. If he can re-read it and improve it so can you.

It actually worked and made money.

(Not because of his algo, as he later learned.)
